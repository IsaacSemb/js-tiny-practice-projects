# 🧠 js-tiny-practice-projects

This is my personal JavaScript practice repository.

Anything I find interesting to build using **vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, I drop in here no frameworks, just raw creativity and learning.

This repository serves as a personal space to sharpen core front-end development skills through consistent, hands-on practice.

Instead of scattering my learning projects across a bunch of GitHub repos, I’ve made one big organized space for all of them. Each mini project lives in its own folder, has its own files, and does one specific thing. It might be a clock. A game. A fun animation. Or just something weird and cool I thought of.

The goal isn’t perfection.  
The goal is **persistence**.

This repo is proof that I’m **showing up every day**, touching the keyboard, and leveling up bit by bit. Even if the projects are tiny, they add up. 10 becomes 20. 20 becomes 100. And every single one is a brick in the foundation of the kind of developer I’m becoming.

> “You don’t have to do a lot every day. But you have to do _something_.”

## 📁 Project Structure

All projects live inside the `/docs` folder, each in its own subfolder like:

```
docs/
├── 0000-homepage/           ← Custom homepage with project links
├── 0001-trailing-hearts/    ← Mini animation project
├── 0002-tic-tac-toe/        ← Game logic project
├── 0003-...                 ← More to come!
```

Each project has:

- An `index.html` to run it
- Optional `script.js`, `styles.css`, images, etc.
- A `README.md` with a quick explanation

The homepage (`/0000-homepage`) links to each live project and is automatically served via GitHub Pages.

Ohhh say less—that's a dope idea.  
You’re basically curating your **Top 5 Hall of Fame** while the rest live quietly in the archive. Respect.

Here’s a cleaner, intentional rewrite of that section to reflect that:

## 🌍 Featured Projects — *My Top 5 Picks*


This section is reserved for my **Top 5 personal favorites**.  
Not necessarily the biggest or flashiest but the ones I’m proud of for reasons that matter to _me_:

- They were hard to build
- Or they taught me something cool
- Or they just made me smile

Out of all the mini projects in this repo, these are the ones that hit different.

### 🏅 Hall of Fame

- 💖 [0001 - Trailing Hearts](https://isaacsemb.github.io/js-tiny-practice-projects/0001-trailing-hearts/)
- ❌⭕ [0002 - Tic Tac Toe](https://isaacsemb.github.io/js-tiny-practice-projects/0002-tic-tac-toe/)
- _(3 more coming soon...)_

> This list will update as I keep building. Top 5 only. No extras.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

This is a **sandbox for consistency**.  
I wanted a place where I can build without pressure, experiment without expectations, and just _code_.

There are no rules here, only the commitment to keep going.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- No frameworks. Just code.

-  Add filtering and search to the homepage (by tag, difficulty, type)
-  Include “Last Updated” info on the homepage for each project

</details>

<details>
<summary>♿ <strong>Accessibility & UX</strong></summary>
